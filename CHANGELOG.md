## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2021-07-20
### Added
- First version inspired by [LSLinter VScode](https://github.com/AdamMcCurdy/lslint-vscode) and parts used with permission
- Added options that allow usage with Firestorm Preprocessor Includes/Switch/LazyList.
- Added support for calling by command, on save or realtime linting.
- Added as many settings options as I could think of that would be useful for someone writing LSL in VS Code to work with LSLint.
- Commented the heck out of the thing so someone could get started modifying it should they wish.
