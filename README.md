# LSLint for VSCode

This extension is for LSL scripts which is a scripting language for the virtual world of [Second Life](https://secondlife.com).

If you are looking for a way to write LSL scripts from VSCode then this extension should help you a lot!

## Three things to note

* You must download and install LSLint yourself for this extension to work. Visit their [releases page](https://github.com/Makopo/lslint/releases/) to download it for your system.
* You must add the folder containing LSLint to your path. This will depend on your operating system and instructions for that will be on your [favorite search engine](https://bfy.tw/RJg8).
* I am not a professional TypeScript/NodeJS programmer and this is the first thing I have ever written in it. Any contributions or fixes are always welcome as Pull Requests.

I decided to work on this because much of the tools for external editors had not been updated in a while and the [extension](https://github.com/AdamMcCurdy/lslint-vscode) I used as inspiration did not work anymore.

There are a lot of upsides to working on your LSL files in VSCode as you always have a backup should you need.

The [Firestorm Preprocessor](https://wiki.firestormviewer.org/fs_preprocessor) is a very helpful to me and since LSLint has support for it, you can enable or disable those features in the settings.

You can reach out to me any time in Second Life through my avatar name [Coal Edge](https://my.secondlife.com/coal.edge), my email [jason@fixedbit.com](mailto:jason@fixedbit.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/FixedBit/).

The code is commented, sometimes too much, just incase it helps someone understand what is going on. It was tested on Windows and Linux (WSL2) but should work the same on macOS.

* Side Note: You will need an external extension for LSL Syntax Highlighting. Right now I use [VSCode LSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vrtlabs.vscode-lsl).

## Known Issues

None at this time.
